##  How It Works (Optional)

Explain the game flow and logic, for example:

- When the page loads, the player can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer selects its choice at random.
- The script compares both choices and determines the result.
- A message and visuals (image/animation) reflect whether the player won, lost, or tied.
